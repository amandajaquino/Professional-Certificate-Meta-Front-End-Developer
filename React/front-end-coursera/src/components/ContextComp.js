// three components update without props, just with context
// we need one component with createContext, MealsProvider. And two consumer MealsList and Counter, for be more elegant.
// we will call this component in app like

/* 
<div>
    <MealsProvider>
        <MealsList />
        <Counter />
    </MealsProvider>
</div>
