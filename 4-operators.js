//equality operator - two values are not the same, but it does not check against the difference in types

/*console.log(5==5);

//strict equality operator - the compared values have to have the same value and the same data type. 

/*console.log(5===5);

//the strict inequality operator - For the strict inequality operator to return false, the compared values have to have the same value and the same data type.

/*console.log("note" + "book")

//The addition assignment operator, += - operator is used when one wants to accumulate the values stored in a variable

/*var mon = 1;
var tue = 2;
var wed = 1;
var thu = 2;
var fri = 3;

overtime += 2;
overtime += 1;
overtime += 2;
overtime += 3;

//The concatenation assignment operator, +=
//This operator's syntax is exactly the same as the addition assignment operator. The difference is in the data type used:
/*var longString = "";
longString += "Once";
longString += " upon";
longString += " a";
longString += " time";
longString += "...";
console.log(longString);*/

//Operator precedence and associativity
//console.log(1 * 2 + 3)
//The result of the above code is 5, because the multiplication operator has precedence over the addition operator.
//var num = 10; // the value on the right is assigned to the variable name on the left
//console.log(5 > 4 > 3); // the 5 > 4 is evaluated first (to `true`), then true > 3 is evaluated to `false`, because the `true` value is coerced to `1`
